Industry is fragmented

Workflow -

* Farmer has a tractor with location info, GPS + sensors

* John Deere -- market leader

* CNH (Case -- New Holland

* Bayer / Monsanto

Low or no cost -- value add by reselling data

limiting geography == field

What Crops

Existing data elements of the field

Core competency + vision

Soil Samples -- sporadic core samples, run from local labs

Alternatives

NAIP

FSA field boundaries -- common land units (redacted due to PII)

USDA cropland data layer

HDF of historic status of fields

Nitrogen application has the most interest


### Limit to Corn and Nitrogen needs

use the plant as a sensor

.q

use Sentinel, WorldView2, NAIP, ASTER, ALI, EOS

### Nitrogen savings plan

### use historic data

###

### SurGo datsets
